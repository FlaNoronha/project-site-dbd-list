              the form of a woman. I heard her before I saw her, a voice, more

              through the trees. While a lament might have been more suited to
              this sepulchral locale, she sang a song of joy, of hope and
              family. Her warm smile greeted any that joined her at the campfire

              Born to Alberto and Caterina Toscano in 1343, Vittorio Toscano was the youngest of three and third in line to inherit his family’s land. At age fifteen, his father sent him to train with Ettore Fabrizio, the same knight who trained his older brothers in the military arts. But Vittorio didn’t take to combat training the way his brothers did. As a student of philosophy, he believed physical violence to be the last refuge of the incompetent.

              If you were to ask, Thalita Lyra would tell you that what she wanted in life more than anything was to bring people together. Whether it was her father selling out clubs for the latest forró band he’d signed, or her mother showing off Botafogo, Lapa, and Ipanema to groups of tourists from around the world, Thalita loved seeing people come together to share their passion and form meaningful connections.

              Growing up, Renato acted less like a child and more like a
              scientist, studying the world and people around him. He would poke
              classmates in the face or stand too close to them, curious to see
              their reaction.

              Gabriel Soma was born in a cloning hub on Proxima Centauri C, the
              first planet humanity colonised. He was part of a small crew that
              maintained and repaired the robots and androids sent to construct
              colonization hubs. Unbeknownst to Gabe, every memory of his
              childhood was implanted in his consciousness by those who cloned
              him. Like the rest of his crew, he believed he was born to a
              mother and father on Earth. Psychological stability was maintained
              by creating a narrative sequence of a loving family. None knew
              that they were, in fact, bred in a colonisation hub.
